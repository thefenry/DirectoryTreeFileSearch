DirectoryTreeFileSearch
=======================

###What is this?
This is a Perl script that will search a directory tree for all files that match the search criteria. When a file is found
it will be put in an array list that can be used later. 

###Why even do this?
This is a project that I had to do for work and after researching online I was able to piece a few lines together. I think 
that this is a useful code and want to share it with others that might need it.

###What can you do?
I do not know Perl as of today so if there is something wrong with my syntax please let me know or suggest improvements.
